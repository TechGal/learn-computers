# learn-computers
A collection of great resources for learning interesting computer technologies, data science, machine learning, and cyber security.

There are so many interesting topics within the field of computers. From mastering the command line, to understanding computer cryptography, to data science and machine learning, there are so many things to learn about. Instead of creating lists of lists of lists, this is my personal list of the resources I've found to be the most helpful for advancing my knowledge of these amazing and scary systems. Feel free to add to this list, fork it and customize it for you, or use it for your own learning. What works for me might not work for you, so I highly reccomend tweaking it as you find things that work for you. The goal is to keep this concise and straighforward, rather than having a list of several hundred bookmarks to read later that will never be read.
